# Bike API

## Context

        The Police want to be more efficient in resolving stolen bike cases. They decided to build a software that can automate their processes
        â€” the software that you're going to develop.

## Requirements

        - Bike owners can report a stolen bike.
        - A bike can have multiple characteristics: license number, color, type, full name of the owner, date, and description of the theft.
        - The Police can increase or decrease the number of police officers.
        - Each police officer should be able to search bikes by different characteristics in a database and see which police officer is responsible for a stolen bike case.
        - New stolen bike ca ses should be automatically assigned to any free police officer.
        - A police officer can only handle one stolen bike case at a time.
        - When the Police find a bike, the case is marked as resolved and the responsible police officer becomes available to take a new stolen bike case.
        - The system should be able to assign unassigned stolen bike cases automatically when a police officer becomes available.

## Your Mission

        - Your task is to provide APIs for a frontend application that satisfies all requirements above.

## Please stick to the Product Requirements.

        You should not implement authorization and authentication, as they are not important for the assessment. Assume everyone can make requests to any api.

## Extra

- publish client package (part of release)
- Specification -> swagger
- Generate Client package
- Cast
